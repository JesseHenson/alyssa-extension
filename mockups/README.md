## üöÄ Next Steps

These mockups serve as the foundation for:

3. **Stakeholder Review**: Demonstrate complete user experience vision
4. **Technical Planning**: Identify required Chrome extension APIs and features

## üìù Usage for Development

Each mockup can be directly translated to:
- Chrome extension popup UI
- New tab override page
- Options page interface
- Onboarding flow screens

The CSS and JavaScript patterns established here should be adapted for the actual Chrome extension architecture while maintaining the established design language and user experience flow.
